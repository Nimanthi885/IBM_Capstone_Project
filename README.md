# IBM Data Analysis Capstone Project-Navigating the IT Skills Landsape: A Data-Driven Analysis
Welcome to my GitHub README! I'm excited to share with you the exciting journey. In this project, I assume that I'm embarking on as a Data Analyst at a renowned global IT and business consulting services firm. Our firm is dedicated to staying at the forefront of IT solutions and relies on the expertise of highly experienced IT consultants. One of our key strategies for success is the continuous analysis of data to identify future skill requirements in the rapidly evolving IT landscape.
## Project Overview
### Mission

As a Data Analyst, my primary mission is to assist the organization in identifying emerging skills required to stay competitive in the IT industry. This involves collecting data from various sources and extracting valuable insights to inform our strategy.
### Key Objectives

My key objectives for this project include:

* Collecting data from diverse sources, including job postings, training portals, and surveys.
* Identifying the top programming languages, database skills, and popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) in demand.
* Preparing the collected data for analysis using data wrangling techniques.
* Applying statistical techniques to analyze the data.
* Creating a comprehensive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics.
* Communicating findings effectively through a compelling presentation.

## Data Collection

To achieve these objectives, I will embark on a multi-step journey, starting with data collection:
### 1. Web Scraping and API Access

I will scrape internet websites and access APIs to gather data from various sources. This will involve retrieving data in different formats such as .csv files, Excel sheets, and databases.
### Data Wrangling

Once I've collected the necessary data, I'll perform data wrangling to ensure it's clean, organized, and ready for analysis. This step is crucial in preparing the data for meaningful insights.
## Data Analysis
### Statistical Techniques

Next, I'll apply statistical techniques to analyze the data. This analysis will help me uncover trends, patterns, and valuable insights related to emerging IT skills.
## Dashboard Creation
### IBM Cognos Analytics

To present the findings effectively, I'll utilize IBM Cognos Analytics to create an interactive and informative dashboard. This will provide a user-friendly platform for stakeholders to explore the data and gain insights.
## Storytelling
### Presentation

Finally, I'll leverage my storytelling skills to craft a compelling presentation that communicates the key findings, trends, and recommendations. This presentation will serve as a vital tool for decision-makers within the organization.
## Evaluation

The culmination of this project will be a final project presentation where I'll demonstrate my abilities as a Data Analyst.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey as I strive to help our organization stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of IT solutions.

Stay tuned for updates on my progress and insights gained from this project!
