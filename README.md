# IBM Data Analysis Capstone Project
This project is to analyse data to help identify future skill requirements. 
The fisrt step of this project is data collection process. We scrap internet web sites and access APIs to collect data in various formats like csv files, excel sheets, and databases. Then we analyse the data using data wrangling techniques and statistical techniques. After that, we create a dashboard by using IBM Cognos Analytics. Finally, we bring all the information together and make a final presentation.
