# IBM Data Analysis Capstone Project
In this project we analyse data to help identify future skill requirements, in order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive. 
The first step of this project is to collect data from various sources. Then, we scrape internet web sites and access APIs to collect data in various formats like csv files, excel sheets, and databases. The next step is data wrangling process which converts raw data into a usable form. Then we analyse data by using statistical techniques. We explore the data to identify distribution, outliers and correlation.  After that, we create a dashboard by using IBM Cognos Analytics. Finally, we bring all the information together and make a final presentation.
