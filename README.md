# IBM_Capstone_Project
In this project, we assume that we have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, we analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. The purpose of this project is to identify  the top programming languages and top database skills in demand and the popular IDEs. 
The first task of this project is data collection process. We scrap internet web sites and access APIs to collect data in various formats like csv files, excel sheets, and databases. Then we analyse the data using data wrangling techniques and statistical techniques. After that, we create a dashboard by using IBM Cognos Analytics. Finally, we bring all the information together and make a final presentation.
